# React-Motorcycle-MERN
App is deployed here: https://motorcycle-group.herokuapp.com/

This project connects to Mongo and Firebase using Express/ React. It utilizes validation that stores the users data on Firebase. Once the user is logged in they can create posts that are stored in MongoDB. The user can edit and delete as well with full acces to all of the pages in the app. If they are not logged in they can only view the log in
or register page.
