# React-Motorcycle-MERN
Notepad project connected to Mongo using Express/ React

This is an app that utilizes validation and 2 databases (MongoDB and Firebase). A user can log his/ her adventure by creating a post, editing and deleting it as well. 
It also uses validation routing so if the user is logged in, they have full acces to all of the pages in the app. If they are not loggin in they can only view the log in
or register page.
